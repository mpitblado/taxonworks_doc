To that end we&#39;re working hard to build a foundation that permits and encourages anyone to contribute to the project. Highlights include:</p><ul><li>All elements of the project are open source.</li><li>Example meta-projects exist, for example <a href="https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxonowrks_stats</a> (<a href="https://stats.taxonworks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</a>) illustrating how to build an application off of the API</li><li>Code generators let you stub a new task view (core feature) or batch-loader in a single line.</li><li>TaxonWorks is built on Rails. The conventions there acts a wrapper around features that can be written in Ruby or other frameworks like <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue</a>, or other webpack supported frameworks.</li><li>TaxonWorks is extensively unit tested. This means you can code and contribute with a lot less fear of breaking things.</li><li>TaxonWorks is deployed in production in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes</a>, cutting edge application deployment and management software.</li><li>The <a href="https://speciesfilegroup.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Species File Group</a> and its members have held hackathons and many in-house joint workshops. Contact them if you&#39;re interested in participating on site. They are also interested in supporting visits to would-be developers, students, or others wishing to get a bootcamp in TaxonWorks development.</li><li>Docker images let you build against the API in your own JavaScript framework with extremely minimal setup.</li></ul>',5),a=[n];function s(l,p){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const h=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/develop/","title":"The big picture","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"sidebarPosition":10},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"How is TaxonWorks supporting developer contributions?","slug":"how-is-taxonworks-supporting-developer-contributions","link":"#how-is-taxonworks-supporting-developer-contributions","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1668380273000,"contributors":[{"name":"mjy","email":"diapriid@gmail.com","commits":3}]},"filePathRelative":"develop/README.md"}');export{h as comp,d as data};
