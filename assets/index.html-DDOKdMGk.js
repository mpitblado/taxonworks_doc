Who are the target audiences for these docs?&quot;</em></p><p>To understand the data model used in TaxonWorks, in addition to the discussion below, there are series of linked resources here.</p><ol><li>Graphical entity-relationship (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;ER&quot;</a>) figures. We use <code>er</code> in the &quot;modelling a domain sense&quot;, not particularly a 1:1 description of the links between model and database (though there are numerous times where this is the case). Algorithmically drawn, their purpose is to provide an overview of how data in TaxonWorks are modelled at a generalized level. To draw these figures certain constraints are used, this means that they are cleaner looking, and not cluttered, but also that they may not completely illustrate all pertinent entities or relationships as defined for that model. Follow the <code>er</code> links or see the <code>Model</code> section. <em>Most nodes can be clicked to navigate onwards.</em></li><li>A description of the database table for each model. Tables are named as seen in the headers. Many (but not all) related tables are linked in the column name. Follow the <code>table</code> links or see the<code>Tables</code> section.</li><li>A text description of each model/class. This is provided in the context of the code for that model on a <a href="https://rdoc.taxonworks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate website</a>. That website is generated with each code commit, it includes the full documentation for the TaxonWorks code-base, so it is easy to get lost for the uninitiated. Follow the <code>rdoc</code> links from the respective tables and models. Using this site as a basis for exploring <code>rdoc</code> can keep you from getting lost therein.</li><li>Direct links (<code>api</code>) to the resources behind the models as represented by TaxonWorks external facing API. For now see documentation at <a href="https://api.taxonworks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.taxonworks.org</a>. Some models do not yet have a corresponding resource. Some models properties and attributes are accessible by related API endpoints.</li></ol><h2 id="audience" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#audience"><span>Audience</span></a></h2><p>There are various target audiences for this information, some served more than others. TaxonWorks users may belong to more than one of these roles, they are not exclusive of one-another. With some small exceptions no one resource here fully meets the needs of these audiences, but with a little imagination they have a role. Those who might make use include:</p>',6),u=n("<li><strong>Developers</strong> - The obvious target group. All resources (<code>er</code>, <code>table</code>, <code>rdoc</code>, <code>api</code>) are routinely referenced during development</li><li><strong>TaxonWorks&#39; scientists</strong> - TaxonWorks has many facets, browsing the <code>er</code> diagrams can illuminate data types that you might not have known existed, or give you a better understanding of how some of interfaces relate to one-another</li><li><strong>Scientists migrating or evolving personal databases</strong> - Perhaps looking for how they might migrate their data into TaxonWorks, <code>table</code> documentation is a potential start for those who seek to migrate their data by scripts</li><li><strong>Ontology curators</strong> - While not a true ontology, many of the models illustrated in the <code>er</code> must be represented in ontologies and all need to be abstracted if ontologies are to represent core needs of biodiversity informatics</li><li><strong>Standards builders</strong> - Software and tools guide standards development, and vice-versa. Because standards take a long time to develop tools often &quot;predict&quot; what might need to be standardized. Tools may directly implement standards or serialize to them. All of the entities, and their attributes here, potentially contribute to the broader standards discussion.</li><li><strong>High-level data modellers</strong> - E.g. those considering archival or indexing resources, <code>er</code> diagrams self-describe their domain, and can be used to get a quick over-view of the kinds of data that data-aggregators might need to integrate at a broader scale</li><li><strong>Students</strong> - Students are perhaps first exposed to taxonomy via specimens in natural history collections, reading papers in print, and in their course work or textbooks. There is whole layer of data-science (biodiversity informatics) behind taxonomy, the illustrations and documentation here can act as a resource for learning about how we describe and classify the Earth&#39;s species.</li>",7),p=e("strong",null,"Scientists",-1),m=e("a",{href:"https://api.taxonworks.org",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"API",-1),g=e("li",null,[e("strong",null,"Semantic web enthusiasts"),t(" - A challenge is to turn the generalized "),e("code",null,"er"),t(" models into RDF, for example how might we see TaxonWorks data in "),e("a",{href:"https://www.wikidata.org",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Wikidata"),t("?
